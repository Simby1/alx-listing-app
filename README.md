# ALX Listing App

This project is a Next.js application, created as an Airbnb clone listing page. The primary goal is to build a well-structured and maintainable codebase, focusing on creating a responsive UI for a property listing page.

## Project Structure

- **components/**: Contains all reusable React components.
- **common/**: Houses generic, stateless components like `Button.tsx` and `Card.tsx` that can be used throughout the application.
- **interfaces/**: A central place for all TypeScript interfaces, ensuring type safety and consistency across the project.
- **constants/**: Stores reusable data, such as API URLs and UI text strings, to avoid hardcoding values.
- **public/assets/**: The folder for all static assets, including images and SVGs.
- **pages/**: The core directory for the Pages Router, where each file corresponds to a specific route.
